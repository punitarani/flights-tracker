# AI Flight Planner - Current Status

## âœ… What's Working (Verified)

Based on the screenshot, the planner is **fully functional**:

1. âœ… **Multi-step tool calling** - Agent executes tools in sequence
2. âœ… **analyzeRoute** - Validates route (728 miles, not same city)
3. âœ… **searchCalendarPrices** - Finds best dates (Nov 15-19, $29)
4. âœ… **searchFlightDetails** - Gets actual flights
5. âœ… **Final response** - Provides recommendations

**The Agent loop works perfectly!** ðŸŽ‰

## Current UI: Plain Text

The response is currently plain text with markdown:

```
First, I'll validate the route: Great! The route is valid...
Now, I'll search for calendar prices...
Best Travel Dates:
Cheapest dates: November 15-19, 2025
Lowest price: $29
Average price: $57
```

## Desired UI: Rich Components

You want to see:

```tsx
<RouteAnalysisUI 
  origin={SFO details}
  destination={PHX details}
  distance={728}
/>

<PriceChartUI 
  prices={[...]}
  cheapestDate="2025-11-15"
  cheapestPrice={29}
/>

<FlightResultsUI 
  flights={[...]}
  route="SFO â†’ PHX"
/>
```

## Why Plain Text Currently

The Agent class uses `streamText` which generates text responses. To get rich UI components, you need `streamUI` from `ai/rsc`.

## streamUI Challenge

**Issue**: streamUI requires JSX in API routes, which needs:

* Server Actions (separate .tsx files)
* Special Next.js configuration
* Different architecture

**Current**: Agent.respond() works great for multi-step tool calling, but returns text

## Recommendation

**Option 1: Post-Process Tool Results (Quick)**

* Keep working Agent class
* Parse tool results from text
* Render UI components client-side based on data
* **Pro**: Works immediately
* **Con**: Not truly AI-generated UI

**Option 2: Full streamUI Migration (Better)**

* Create server actions with streamUI
* Properly integrate RSC
* AI generates actual React components
* **Pro**: True AI-generated UI
* **Con**: Requires significant refactoring

## Next Session Plan

1. Decide on Option 1 (quick) vs Option 2 (proper)
2. Implement chosen approach
3. Test rich UI rendering
4. Polish and deploy

## Current Achievement

**The planner works end-to-end with perfect multi-step tool calling!** The Agent class is functioning exactly as intended. It just needs the visual layer enhanced.

**Status**: âœ… Core functionality complete
**Next**: Add rich UI visualization layer
