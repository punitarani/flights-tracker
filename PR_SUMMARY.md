# MapKit JS API Update - PR Summary

## Overview
This PR updates the MapKit JS integration to use Apple's new high-performance loading API with `mapkit.core.js`, which is the recommended approach as of 2024-2025.

## Problem Statement
The application was using the legacy `mapkit.js` script, which Apple has updated to a new high-performance loading approach using `mapkit.core.js` with callback-based initialization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated MapKit Script URL
**File**: `src/lib/mapkit-service.ts`
- Changed from: `https://cdn.apple-mapkit.com/mk/5.x.x/mapkit.js`
- Changed to: `https://cdn.apple-mapkit.com/mk/5.x.x/mapkit.core.js`

### 2. Implemented New Loading Pattern
**File**: `src/lib/mapkit-service.ts`
- Added callback-based initialization using `data-callback="initMapKit"`
- Added library specification using `data-libraries="map,annotations"`
- Implemented `window.initMapKit` callback handler
- Added early return check for already-loaded MapKit via `loadedLibraries`

### 3. Enhanced TypeScript Definitions
**Files**: 
- `src/lib/mapkit-service.ts` - Added `loadedLibraries?: MapKitLibrary[]` to `MapKit` interface
- `src/lib/mapkit-service.ts` - Added `initMapKit?: () => void` to global `Window` interface
- `src/types/mapkit.d.ts` - Added `const loadedLibraries: string[]` to mapkit namespace

### 4. Security Best Practice
- Token is provided via `authorizationCallback` (not in DOM)
- No `data-token` attribute to avoid exposing token in HTML

## Technical Details

### New Loading Flow
1. Script tag created with `data-callback` and `data-libraries` attributes
2. Global `window.initMapKit` callback registered before script injection
3. MapKit calls `initMapKit` when ready
4. Script loading promise resolves
5. `mapkit.init()` called with `authorizationCallback` to provide token
6. Libraries loaded via `importLibrary` or automatic loading

### Why This Change?
Apple's new `mapkit.core.js` approach:
- **Faster loading**: Only loads core functionality initially
- **On-demand libraries**: Loads additional features as needed
- **Better performance**: Optimized bundle splitting
- **Modern API**: Callback-based initialization

## Testing

### Automated Tests
- ✅ **Linting**: All code passes Biome linter
- ✅ **Type Checking**: TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ **Build**: Next.js build completes without errors

### Manual Testing Required
After deploying, verify:
1. Map renders correctly with tiles visible
2. Airport markers display properly
3. Route lines draw correctly between airports
4. Map interactions work (zoom, pan, rotate)

## Known Issue - Not Fixed by This PR

**401 Authorization Error**: If you see this error in the console:
```
[MapKit] Initialization failed because the authorization token is invalid.
Origin does not match - expected: graypane.com, actual: https://www.graypane.com
```

**Root Cause**: MapKit token domain mismatch
**Resolution**: Update MapKit JS token in Apple Developer Console to include both:
- `graypane.com`
- `www.graypane.com`

This is a configuration issue on Apple's side and not a code issue.

## Backward Compatibility
This change maintains full backward compatibility:
- Existing authorization callback approach unchanged
- Map component API unchanged
- All existing features continue to work

## Deployment Notes
1. No environment variable changes required
2. No database migrations needed
3. Safe to deploy immediately
4. Ensure MapKit token has correct domain configuration
